In the past twenty years we have witnessed a surge in methodological innovations for small-area estimation. In short, scholars often have nationally representative survey data and would like to create sub-national, e.g., state-level, estimates based on these data. Multilevel regression with post-stratification (MrP) has emerged as the gold standard to achieve this goal \citep{selb2011estimating}. Different improvements to the original MrP model have been proposed and the latest developments combine insights from statistical learning and MrP to provide better estimates. This article introduces the \proglang{R} package \pkg{autoMrP} which allows users to fit traditional MrP models as well as leverage a number of prediction algorithms. This allows building optimized models for generating sub-national estimates from national survey data that outperform those generated by simple MrP models.
